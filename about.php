                            Hey, I'm Andrew.<br>
                            I'm a junior web<br>
                            developer at Dowell Windows<br>
                            in Melbourne. <br>

                            As an alumnus of RMIT University, I have the opportunity <br>
                            to utilise my programming skills and project management <br>
                            while learning to apply to true factual scenarios in my <br>
                            current job as a junior software developer for Dowell Windows <br>
                            and Doors. I value personal development as I am motivated to <br>
                            seek new ways to challenge myself. By stepping outside of my <br>
                            comfort zone, it helps me to keep an open mind which allows <br>
                            me to be frequently learning and experiencing.
